        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Summary:</b> I personally would say this is like one of those self-help books with styles borrowed from Dale Carnegie. The books starts with the author's claim &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he is not an MBA grad and that you do not need to have an MBA to be able to leverage your skill. The topics are the most obvious ones. I was totally stuck &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with 76 pages devoted just to prove his point that MBA degree is overvalued. If you are into self-help, you may find this helpful. But, I could not find any &nbsp; valuable point on what is totally an obvious subject that the author seemed to be highlighting.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Summary:</b>The review aggregator website Book Marks reported that 44% of critics gave the book a "rave" review, whilst 11% of the critics "panned" the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;book. The rest of the critics expressed either "positive" (22%) or "mixed" (22%) impressions, based on a sample of nine reviews.[4] The book had articles and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reviews published by The New York Times, The Economist,[5] Financial Times, The Guardian, New Statesman, and The Times.

        
        
        The book has also received &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negative reviews. Gavin Jacobson in the New Statesman sees it as "a study thick with promise and thin in import" with advice "either too vague or too hollow to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provide any meaningful guidance."[8] In The Times, Gerard DeGroot writes: "The author of Sapiens is good at identifying the crises to come but his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; syrupy platitudes are no answer."
